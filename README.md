# Generating-simulated-city-road-networks

One of the common problems faced by massive virtual worlds is the creation of large amounts of content to populate them. For example, a game involving a large number of urban areas might require unique, ‘believable’ road networks too expensive to each create by hand. One option is therefore to generate this content algorithmically.


Algorithm gives following output, representing 3 cartesian coordinates and the indexs which are connected by roads:

2, 3.1, 1.2
3.5, 2.6, 10.1
4.1, 3.4, 7.44
0, 1
1, 2
